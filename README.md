Website Development Proposal for Elegant Scents – Perfume and Cologne Company

Organisation overview 

•	Client Name: Elegant Scents

•	Elegant Scents is a South African Based fragrance shop that is only focused on selling 
Colognes, Perfumes and Perfume oils. It is located in Mpumalanga, Nelspruit.  But can ship their products anywhere in South Africa.

Mission statement 
Elegant Scents aims to ensure that everyone smells good and feels confident every season of the year and at a very affordable price.

Vision
Elegant Scents intends to have at least one store in each and  every province in South Africa in the next 7 years to ensure that more people smell great and have a higher self esteem at a very affordable price.

Target audience
Elegant scents targets individuals between the ages of 20-50 years of age, who just want to smell good when going to school,  work or just going about their day


Website Goals and Objectives
The primary goals and objectives of the website are to

•	Increase Online Sale.
Increased online sales will lead to an increased revenue so that the organization can grow and expand at a faster rate.

•	Responsive Design.
The design must not be laggy and unresponsive because customers will lose interest, instead it must be fast and efficient for customers to be interested in wanting to order from it.

•	Inform Customers.
Website must be very informative so that customers will know what they are buying.

Website Features and Functionality
The Elegant Scents website has the following features:

Home page
Consists of a very colourful design that is also topped with high quality pictures of newly featured products in order to grab the customers attention at first glance.

About Us
Contains background information about the company as a whole, like when and where it was established and where the physical store is located.

Products
Contains high quality images of some of the products sold on the website including their names and prices.

Contact
Contains directions to the physical store and  various ways to get in touch with the company, whether to buy or if you want any additional information.

Enquiries
Contains information on what to do if you have want to be part of the Elegant Scents team and be a reseller or promoter of the products.

Design and User Experience
•	Colour scheme:
A simple black, white, red, blue and gray colour scheme. It is very interesting and attractive without being too harsh on the eye.

•	Product images:
Extremely high quality, professional photos of the products which are very clear to see on any device.

Technical Requirements
The website  is created using visual studio code and the programming language used is HTML and for styling CSS  was used. It requires maintenance by a qualified web developer and I am available for that.
